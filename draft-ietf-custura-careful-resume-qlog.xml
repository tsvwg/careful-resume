<section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
 <t> This document defines a way to provide logging for Careful Resume<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-careful-resume"></xref>
     when used with QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"></xref><xref target="RFC9002"></xref>.
 </t>
    <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-careful-resume"></xref> defines a
    Congestion Control (CC) mechanism
    called Careful Resume, which is expected to
    reduce the time to complete a transfer
    when the transfer sends significantly more data than allowed by the
    Initial congestion Window (IW), and
    where the BDP of the path is also significantly
    more than the IW.
    It introduces an alternative mechanism to select initial CC parameters that
    seeks to more rapidly and safely grow the sending rate controlled by
    the congestion window (CWND). CC algorithms that are rate-based can make
    similar adjustments to their target sending rate.</t>
     
    <t>When used with the QUIC transport, Careful Resume provides transport services that resemble
    those that could be implemented in TCP, using methods such as TCP Control Block (TCB)
    <xref target="RFC9040"></xref> caching.</t>
