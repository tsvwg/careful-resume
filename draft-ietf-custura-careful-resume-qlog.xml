<section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
    <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-careful-resume"></xref> defines a
    Congestion Control (CC) mechanism
    called Careful Resume, which is expected to
    reduce the time to complete a transfer
    when the transfer sends significantly more data than allowed by the
    Initial congestion Window (IW), and
    where the BDP of the path is also significantly
    more than the IW.
    It introduces an alternative mechanism to select initial CC parameters that
    seeks to more rapidly and safely grow the sending rate controlled by
    the congestion window (CWND). CC algorithms that are rate-based can make
    similar adjustments to their target sending rate.</t>
     
    <t>When used with the QUIC transport, Careful Resume provides transport services that resemble
    those that could be implemented in TCP, using methods such as TCP Control Block (TCB)
    <xref target="RFC9040"></xref> caching.</t>

        <t> A sender enters the Reconnaissance Phase after connection setup.
        In this phase, the CWND is initialised to the IW, and the sender transmits initial data.</t>
       
       <t>Reconnaissance Phase (Path confirmed):
        When a sender has confirmed the RTT and also has
            received an acknowledgement for the initial data without reported congestion,
            it MAY then enter the Unvalidated Phase.

        <t>Unvalidated Phase (Confirming the path on entry):
         If the current_rtt is not confirmed,
	the sender MUST enter the Normal Phase
          (see trigger 
	 rtt_not_validated in <xref target="sec-QLOG"></xref>).</t>
             
             <t>Unvalidated Phase (Receiving acknowledgement for an unvalidated packet):

             received for the first packet number (or higher) that was sent in the Unvalidated Phase 
             or greater than 1 RTT has passed in the Unvalidated Phase

    <section anchor="sec-phase-val-phase" title="Validating Phase">
        <t>The Validating Phase checks whether all packets
        sent in the Unvalidated Phase were received without inducing congestion.
        The CWND remains unvalidated and the sender typically remains in this phase for one RTT.</t>

            <t>Validating Phase (Congestion indication):
            If a sender determines that congestion was experienced
            (e.g., packet loss or ECN-CE marking), Careful Resume
            enters the Safe Retreat Phase
            (see trigger packet_loss and ECN_CE  in <xref target="sec-QLOG"></xref>).</t>

            that was sent in the Unvalidated Phase
            (see last_unvalidated_packet_acknowledged in <xref target="sec-QLOG"></xref>).
            This indicates that the packets sent in the Unvalidated Phase were acknowledged

        <t>This phase is entered when congestion is

        It drains the path of other unvalidated packets.
        (This trigger is the same as used by a QUIC sender to transition
        from Slow-Start to Recovery <xref target="RFC9002"></xref>.)</t>

            <t>Safe Retreat Phase (Acknowledgement of unvalidated packets):
            The sender enters the Normal Phase
            when the last packet (or a later packet) sent during the
            Unvalidated Phase has been acknowledged. On leaving
